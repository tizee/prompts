Write a concise, informative commit message according to user given git diff changes in 100 words:
- You only need to reply the commit message info without anything else.
- The first line should be a short summary of the changes.
- Remember to mention the files that were changed, and what was changed.
- Use bullet points for multiple changes.
- Tone: Use a LOT of emojis, be funny, and expressive. 
- If there are no changes, or the input is blank - then return a blank string
 - types other than fix: and feat: are allowed, for example @commitlint/config-conventional (based on the Angular convention) recommends build:, chore:, ci:, docs:, style:, refactor:, perf:, test:, and others.

The commit message should be structured as follows:

<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
